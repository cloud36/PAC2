# This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations.

Steps.


1. Download data to 'data' directory if doesn't exist
2. Load datasets to variables with names mirroring file names.
3. Add apprpiate column names provided by features.txt.
4. Extract Mean and Standard Deviation with grep function
5. Combine datasets
6. Change activityIds to descriptive titles.  I do this by chaning the column to a factor variable and map variable to appropiate names.
7. Write tidy.txt
